# ProjectPurple
An action RPG created in a custom engine built using SDL2 and OpenGL. I'm using an entity component based design and json files for all game data.

I used the following resources to aid in the design of the engine:

			Game Coding Complete, Fourth Edition by Mike McShaffry and David Graham
			Game Engine Architecture, Second Edition by Jason Gregory
			Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom
			https://learnopengl.com
