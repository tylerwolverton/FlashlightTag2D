# FlashlightTag2D
The classic game of flashlight tag recreated with SDL2 and OpenGL.

I used the following resources to aid in the design of the engine:

			Game Coding Complete, Fourth Edition by Mike McShaffry and David Graham
			Game Engine Architecture, Second Edition by Jason Gregory
			Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom
